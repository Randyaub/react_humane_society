# Humane-Society

This website is a landing page for a hypothetical humane society website

## Motivation

My motivation for making this landing page came from viewing the Regina Humane Society. This is my hometowns humane society website and
I always thought it looked messy. The banner doesnt scale to 4k resolution, and the section that includes their location and social medias
felt un-natural to me. So I decided to try to create a humane society website landing page in my own vision. Trying to focus on clarity of
viewing.

The website I was referencing: [Regina Humane Society](https://reginahumanesociety.ca/)
